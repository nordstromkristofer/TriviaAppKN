## Technologies Used

The Trivia App is built using the following technologies:

- Angular: A popular JavaScript framework for building web applications
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web pages
- CSS: Styling language for customizing the app's appearance
- HTTP Client: Angular's built-in module for making HTTP requests to the API

## API Integration
